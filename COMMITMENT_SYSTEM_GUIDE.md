# Action Commitments System - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Action Commitments System is a comprehensive accountability feature that allows users to commit to completing good deeds (actions) if they relapse. This system includes photo/video proof verification, partner accountability, service hour tracking, and a public redemption wall.

## Database Schema

### Tables Created
1. **actions** - Pre-defined good deeds users can commit to
2. **commitments** - User commitments with target dates and status tracking
3. **action_proofs** - Photo/video evidence submitted by users
4. **user_service_stats** - Aggregate statistics for each user
5. **redemption_wall** - Public feed of completed redemptions

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# Execute the SQL migration
mysql -u your_user -p your_database < migrations/create_action_commitments_tables.sql
```

### 2. Seed Default Actions
```bash
# Run the seeding script
npm run seed:actions
```

Or add to package.json:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "seed:actions": "ts-node scripts/seedActions.ts"
  }
}
```

### 3. Register Routes in server.ts
```typescript
import commitmentRoutes from './routes/commitments';

// Register in your server setup
await fastify.register(commitmentRoutes, { prefix: '/api' });
```

### 4. Setup Cron Jobs
Add to your cron job scheduler:
```typescript
import commitmentService from './services/commitmentService';

// Check for overdue commitments hourly
cron.schedule('0 * * * *', async () => {
  await commitmentService.checkOverdueCommitments();
});

// Auto-approve pending proofs daily
cron.schedule('0 2 * * *', async () => {
  await commitmentService.autoApproveProofs();
});
```

## File Upload Configuration

### TODO: S3/Cloud Storage Integration
The current implementation uses placeholder URLs for media files. You need to integrate with your cloud storage solution (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.).

Update in `routes/commitments.ts`:
```typescript
## File Upload Configuration

### ‚úÖ S3/Cloud Storage Integration (IMPLEMENTED)
The system now uses the existing S3 implementation via `screenshotStorageService`.

**Location:** `src/routes/commitments.ts` (submit-proof endpoint)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
import { uploadScreenshotImage } from '../services/screenshotStorageService';

// Upload to S3
const buffer = Buffer.from(mediaBase64, 'base64');
const uploadResult = await uploadScreenshotImage({
  userId,
  buffer,
  mimeType: mimeType || 'image/jpeg',
  prefix: 'action-proofs', // Stored in action-proofs folder
});

const mediaFile = {
  url: uploadResult.publicUrl || `storage://${uploadResult.storageKey}`,
  thumbnailUrl: uploadResult.publicUrl || `storage://${uploadResult.storageKey}`,
  storageKey: uploadResult.storageKey,
};
```

**Storage Configuration:**
- Files are stored in the `action-proofs/{userId}/` folder structure
- Uses the same S3 bucket and credentials as screenshot storage
- Supports both public URLs and presigned URLs
- Configuration is in `src/config/environment.ts` (screenshotStorageConfig)
```

## Notification Integration

### TODO: Setup Push Notifications
Integrate with your existing notification system to send alerts for:
- Partner selected for commitment
- Relapse reported (to partner)
- Proof submitted (to partner for verification)
- Proof approved/rejected (to user)
- Deadline reminders (24h, 12h, 2h, 1h before)
- Deadline missed
- Auto-approval completed

Example integration points in `commitmentService.ts`:
```typescript
// After creating commitment
await notificationService.send(data.partnerId, {
  title: "You've been chosen as accountability partner",
  body: `${user.firstName} selected you to help with their commitment`,
  type: 'COMMITMENT_PARTNER_SELECTED',
  data: { commitmentId: commitment.id }
});
```

## Features

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Database schema and models
- Core service layer with business logic
- API endpoints (structure)
- Action seeding script
- Service statistics tracking
- Redemption wall functionality
- Partner verification system
- Deadline checking
- Late submission handling

### üîÑ TODO (Integration Required)
1. ‚úÖ **File Upload**: S3 integration completed via uploadScreenshotImage
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Add thumbnail generation for videos
2. ‚úÖ **Notifications**: Push notifications integrated with PushQueue
   - Partner selection notifications
   - Relapse reported notifications (user & partner)
   - Proof submission notifications
   - Proof approval/rejection notifications
   - Deadline missed notifications
   - Auto-approval notifications
3. ‚úÖ **Route Completion**: TypeScript errors fixed
4. **Reminders**: Setup cron jobs for deadline reminders (basic implementation done)
5. **Geolocation**: Add reverse geocoding for addresses
6. **Image Processing**: Add thumbnail generation for videos
7. **Badges/Achievements**: Award badges for service milestones
8. **Financial Integration**: Payment processing for HYBRID commitments
9. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
10. **Documentation**: API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

## Status Workflow

```
ACTIVE (User creates commitment)
   ‚Üì
[User reports relapse]
   ‚Üì
ACTION_PENDING (User has 48 hours to complete action)
   ‚Üì
[User submits proof]
   ‚Üì
ACTION_PROOF_SUBMITTED (Waiting for partner verification)
   ‚Üì
[Partner approves] ‚Üí ACTION_COMPLETED ‚úÖ
[Partner rejects] ‚Üí ACTION_PENDING (resubmit)
[Deadline passes] ‚Üí ACTION_OVERDUE ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

## Commitment Types

1. **ACTION**: Complete a good deed if you relapse
2. **FINANCIAL**: Donate money if you relapse (future)
3. **HYBRID**: Both action AND financial consequence

## Edge Cases Handled

- Partner doesn't respond within 48h ‚Üí Auto-approve
- User misses deadline ‚Üí Mark as overdue, break streak
- Multiple proof submissions ‚Üí Mark previous as superseded
- Custom actions ‚Üí Require partner verification
- Late completions ‚Üí Partial credit, marked as late
- GPS requirements ‚Üí Optional but logged for verification

## Security Considerations

- All endpoints require authentication
- Users can only access their own commitments (except partners)
- Partner authorization checked for verification requests
- File upload validation needed (size, type, malicious content)
- Rate limiting recommended for proof submissions
- Image moderation recommended for public redemption wall

## Performance Optimizations

- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Pagination on redemption wall and lists
- Caching for action lists (rarely change)
- Lazy loading of related data
- Background jobs for notifications and reminders

## Next Steps

1. Fix TypeScript errors in `routes/commitments.ts`
2. Integrate file upload service
3. Wire up notification system
4. Add cron jobs for automated tasks
5. Test end-to-end flows
6. Deploy and monitor
